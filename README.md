# Shipping Form

## Overview

This repository contains a basic shipping form that utilizes Regular Expressions to validate user inputs, and give feedback in the form of changes to the input fields border colors. If the user's input passes or fails the regular expression the fields border color will change to green or orange respectively.

This project is by Gage Pickle, for CIS 277 at SouthWestern Illinois College.
